#### **Introduction**
$KARRAT is set to launch between Q1 and Q2 this year, serving as the utility and governance token within the My Pet Hooligan ecosystem. Initially, early access to the token is available exclusively through ownership of a Hooligan NFT.

#### **Staking and Token Utility**
Owners of Hooligan NFTs were able to stake their tokens to earn skarrots daily, which will be convertible to $KARRAT at a 1:1 ratio upon launch. The staking benefits included bonuses for owning Hooligans from multiple factions. Although initial staking has ended, the community may vote to reintroduce or alter staking features.

#### **Governance and Community Empowerment**
$KARRAT introduces a decentralized governance model where the community owns 30% of the tokens. This significant stake empowers them to vote on a wide range of proposals, from community project funding to continuation of staking mechanisms and other utility features within the ecosystem.

#### **Strategic Importance of Community Ownership**
Owning 30% of the tokens places significant control in the hands of the community, facilitating a shift towards a truly decentralized model of operation where community members can propose, vote on, and fund projects like new games or other innovative ventures within the ecosystem.

#### **Continued Development and Documentation**
The detailed development, strategic plans, and ongoing updates about $KARRAT can be accessed through the official documentation, which provides comprehensive insights into the governance structure, tokenomics, and future roadmap.
