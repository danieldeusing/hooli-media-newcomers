#### **Introduction to ZuckBots**
ZuckBots are a growing part of the My Pet Hooligan (MPH) ecosystem, designed as in-game companions within the main Rabbit Hole game. Originating from MetaZuckâ€™s factory, these bots will enhance gameplay by providing new abilities and support in future game versions. They also have their own mobile game in development, featuring a mix of mechanics inspired by Super Smash Bros, Tamagotchi, and Battle Bots in 3D.

#### **Game Integration and Utility**
- **In-Game Companions:** ZuckBots will act as companions in the Rabbit Hole, offering protection and a variety of functional abilities similar to Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot but with enhanced capabilities.
- **Access and Privileges:** Owning a ZuckBot grants access to the Rabbit Hole game, providing more privileges than free players but less than Genesis Hooligan holders.
- **Creator Tools Compatibility:** All ZuckBots will integrate with creator tools like Hooligram and immi.io, enhancing their utility within the MPH ecosystem.

#### **Mobile Game and Customization**
The upcoming PvP mobile game, 'Battle Bots', will allow players to customize and upgrade their ZuckBots to battle against others. This game will be accessible on both Android and iOS platforms.

#### **ZuckBot Ecosystem Components**
- **Keys:** Players can burn keys they've acquired to receive items like QT ZuckBot, Legz ZuckBot, or a ZuckBox through the SPROUT system (currently undergoing migration and updates).
- **ZuckBox:** Burning a ZuckBox provides various components like Hoverboard, Scrap Metal, and more, which are essential for in-game building and customization.
- **Parts Utilization:** The parts obtained from ZuckBox burns will be crucial for future building activities within the game, though specific requirements will vary based on player choices.
