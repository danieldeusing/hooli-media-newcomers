#### **Introduction to My Pet Hooligan**
My Pet Hooligan is an action-packed, free-to-play game that combines elements from popular titles like Grand Theft Auto and Zootopia, set within a vivid Metaverse known as The Rabbit Hole, developed by AMGI Studios. This game is designed in Unreal Engine 5.0 and emphasizes both desktop and console platforms, introducing players to a blockchain-driven universe where gameplay and digital ownership merge seamlessly.

#### **Game Setting and Premise**
The Rabbit Hole is part of a larger Metaverse called Interloop. It began with the NFT collection of 8,888 Hooligans poised to defend Web 3.0 against the oppressive corporate overlord, MetaZuckBot, CEO of Zuck Corp. Players engage in a multiplayer beta game described as a giant Hooligan Party, blending blockchain technology with rich animation and gaming.

#### **The Hooligan NFTs - Genesis Collection**
Each Hooligan from the Genesis Collection serves as a unique playable character within this ever-expanding Metaverse. These 3D characters are not only a core part of the game's mechanics but also packed with utility and intricate lore. However, owning an NFT is not a requirement to play My Pet Hooligan.

#### **Economic Model and Utility**
The in-game economy previously revolved around the $skarrot token, which players could earn and stake for various rewards. Staking has ended, and further staking will be possible only if voted by the KARRATco. All $skarrots will be converted to the new token, $KARRAT, enhancing the ecosystem's utility and integration.

#### **Lore and Background**
Historically, the Hooligans were forced to farm $karrots under the tyranny of MetaZuckBot. A rebellion led these creatures to free themselves and form factions, each with unique characteristics and a shared mission to overthrow their oppressor.

#### **Factions and Gameplay Dynamics**
- **Mutants:** Known for their unpredictability after surviving extreme experiments.
- **Punk Bunnis:** Musical rebels with a disdain for corporate control.
- **Cypherbuns:** Techno-savvy hackers and crucial to digital warfare.
- **Rogue Jumpers:** Athletic and competitive, always ready for a brawl.
- **Playboyz:** The sophisticated lot, enjoying refined pleasures.
- **Bunners:** Easygoing souls with a penchant for life's greener sides.
- **Hare Raisers:** Aggressive and vengeful, skilled in sabotage.

Owning NFTs from multiple factions grants bonuses, enhancing gameplay and rewards.

#### **Gameplay Features**
My Pet Hooligan offers diverse modes like Coinpocalypse for intense coin collection and Anarchy mode for free-for-all battles, along with a Hangout mode for more casual, social interactions within the game. The game is rich with dynamic environments, detailed character interactions, and extensive customization options.

#### **Technical and Creative Aspects**
The game showcases cutting-edge facial recognition technologies and high-quality animations that enrich the player's experience, making each character's actions and reactions feel unique and personal.
